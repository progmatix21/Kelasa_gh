# Kelasa
## A Simple Task Tracker

Kelasa is a simple task tracker written using HTML/Javascript for your desktop.
Kelasa uses TaffyDB, the Javascript database available at:  
https://github.com/typicaljoe/taffydb/raw/master/taffy.js

### Origin of the name:

'Kelasa' is a Kannada word that translates as 'work'. 

### What can it do?

- Add tasks with description, due date and search tags.
- Edit an existing task.
- Delete an existing task.
- Search tasks based on keywords and tags.

### Installation

There is no installation: you just need to copy kelasa.html and taffy.js into the same folder and open kelasa.html in your browser to get started.  Alternatively, you can just open kelasa.html and you will be prompted to download taffy.js.

You can also convert Kelasa into a webapp on Linux using Webapp Manager.

### Typical usage

Kelasa can be used to track development tasks or documentation tasks.

### Quick Start

- Add a task. Press the *Add Task* button and fill out the form. Press *Update* to add the task to your task list.

- Edit a task. On the main page, click the Task ID hyperlink. The task form opens with prefilled details. Modify the details and click *Update*.

- Delete a task. On the main page, click the Task ID hyperlink. The task form opens with prefilled details. Click on *Delete* to delete the task. **This action cannot be undone.**

- Search tasks. On the main page, enter your keywords or tags in the search field and click search. The task view table updates on the screen to display the matching tasks. 

### Important

Kelasa uses the browser DB for persistence of the task list. So if you change your browser or the name of the HTML file(from kelasa to any other name) you stand to lose access to your previous task list.
